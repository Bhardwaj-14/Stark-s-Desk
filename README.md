# Stark-s-Desk
I am making a Workspace inspired by Tony Stark's holographic desk. The desk would contain a transparent display, a 3D Printer, a custom built glass keyboard. The display would be powered by hand Tracking to get the effect of interacting with the hologram. The workspace would also contain my AI called ORIGIN(this is inspired by JARVIS too...)
