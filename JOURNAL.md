## 10/23/2025 - 23rd Oct - Figuring out the illusion  

So this is the first journal entry. The hologram which is seen in the movies are still harder to achieve with today's technology. Many use smoke and project on it, some use a projector and a transparent acrylic sheet. Recently with the introduction of transparent screens/display many are using that. But these display's are hella expensive. So, the solution would be to make a transparent display but it should be cheap too. 

After some research and understanding how a display works and talking a bit to GPT, I found out that we can repurpose old monitors to get a transparent display. But unfortunately I don't even have a monitor. I just have a laptop(which I ofc am using so not gonna break it).

So now maybe the only option is to find a cheap but yet a good display.

**Procedure**: Well in short. We remove the backlight from the monitor and now the display is semi transparent. There are some more tips on YT to make it look more transparent tho but this is the main idea. Remove the backlight...


**Another Problem and solution:** Removing backlight will cause the display to be veeeeery low lit. OFC, thats expected. Now the solution. make the theme bluish. Anyways I'm not gonna use windows etc on it. It'll just display 3D models and run my own AI assistant ORIGIN inspired by JARVIS(Coming soon, maybe the next project). Blue is much more visible than an other color so this is sorted too!.

This is the Cheap one, has HDMI so can go with an RPI 3/4 and also has good refresh rate and is big too. Enough for this project!
